Puzzles 

	Welcome to my puzzles three!
	Each of them was made by me!
	If you win, I'll set you free,
	but if you lose... Well, you'll see...

	Mare-Care (Easy)
		Move the sheep, if you dare
		the numbers on the row tell how many are there 
		The columns tell the same just to keep it fair
		You only get one turn, so best take care!
		
	Light Battle (Med)
		Puzzle two takes place at night
		you must move each shining light
		if there's darkness, then you're not right!
		So take care to make each square real bright.

	Star Battle (Difficult)
		Into each room one sheep must go
		and also one sheep in each column and row
		But if two sheep are adjacent, then Oh No!
		You'll be defeated by your foe.
		
	Disco Colors (Bonus)
		It's getting late, you should be in bed,
		but I'll make you move more sheep instead
		They'll turn adjacent red blue and adjacent blue red 
		Be sure there's no blue, or you'll be dead!
